# imquest

**imquest** is a Python package that allows users to search for photos from multiple free and freemium photo APIs, including Pexels, Unsplash, and Flickr. By default, searches are performed across all three APIs, with results filtered by keyword, orientation, and size.

Users can also search for photos by location using latitude and longitude, which defaults to using Flickr's API. **imquest** makes it easy to quickly find high-quality photos for use in personal and commercial projects.
